STOCK-MANAGER
I am Yasmine Ben Yaala, a student at the National School of Information Sciences. My colleagues, Nourhen Aloui, Salma Makina and I developed an application Stock-Manager .
Stock-Manager is a simple stock management cmd application written in C language.
It allows you to see the current stock of products, and also to see the history of entries and exits
day by day over the month, then month by month. It then keeps the histories in an archive.
Stock Manager also performs various tasks such as adding, displaying, deleting, modifying and searching for a product.
